# Stylit 

## Summary
Stylit is a react native application, where a user can scan or upload a photo of their face and get a recommendation of a hairstyle that would suit them. The app also allows the user to save their favorite hairstyles and view them later. It uses artificial inteligence and facial recognition to determine the user's face shape and hair type. We then compare the users vecotr data to a database of 15,000 hairstyles and recommend the best hairstyle for the user, based off of their face shape.
